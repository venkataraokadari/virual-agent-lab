# Product_Info

User – What is the expected service time of my ICD?

**Alternatives**
What is the service time of the device?
What is the expected end of life?
How long will this ICD last?

Giva – What model of device are you using?

		User – The Lumax model

			Giva – For the single chamber or dual chamber?

				User – Single Chamber

					Giva - The single chamber Lumax (Lumax 300 VR, Lumax 340 VR, Lumax 300 VR T, and Lumax 340 VR T) ICDs are intended to operate for more than 4 years under normal use.  Keep in mind that the service time of an ICD⁄CRT D can vary based on several factors, including the number of charge sequences, programmed parameters, number of tachyarrhythmias detected, relative amount of bradycardia pacing required, pacing lead impedance, storage time, battery properties, and circuit operating characteristics. Service time is the time from beginning of service (BOS) to the elective replacement indication (ERI).

				User – Dual Chamber

					Giva - The dual chamber Lumax 500⁄540 variants (Lumax 500 DR T, and Lumax 540 DR T) of ICDs are intended to operate for more than 6 years under normal use. Keep in mind that the service time of an ICD⁄CRT D can vary based on several factors, including the number of charge sequences, programmed parameters, number of tachyarrhythmias detected, relative amount of bradycardia pacing required, pacing lead impedance, storage time, battery properties, and circuit operating characteristics. Service time is the time from beginning of service (BOS) to the elective replacement indication (ERI).

# Troubleshooting

User – I am having trouble getting readings on the monitoring system.

**Alternatives**
I’m not getting readings on my ICD
Monitoring is not working on the Lumax
How do I get readings from the ICD?

	Giva – Are we still working on the Lumax single chamber ICD?

		User – Yes

			Giva – Is home monitoring enabled?

				User – Yes

					Giva – Ok what does the status indicator show?

						User – It’s green

							Giva - If you do not see readings, please make sure the time of transmission is set correctly and verify the programmer time prior to programming the transmission time as the device time is based on the current programmer time

								User – Okay, that worked. I corrected the transmission time and see the readings.
				User – No

					Giva – Ok, The Master Switch must be turned ON and the Status Indicator must show Enabled. Turn on Monitoring then check the Status Indicator of the Master Switch:
          Green = full detection and therapy options available
          Yellow = limited detection and therapy options available
          Red = no therapy options are available or the status is unclear

						User – Ok I made the change, it’s showing green now

							Giva - If you do not see readings, please make sure the time of transmission is set correctly and verify the programmer time prior to programming the transmission time as the device time is based on the current programmer time

								User – Ok, that worked. I corrected the transmission time and see the readings.

#Issue_Lookup

User – The patient is reporting multiple slight shocks

**Alternatives**
Patient is reporting shocks from their ICD
Repeated shocks are reported by the patient
The patient is complaining of slight shocks from the ICD

	Giva – Can you confirm the shock therapy setting is off?

		User – It is

			Giva – It appears the device may be malfunctioning. I will transfer you to an agent who can provide further assistance.

				Agent – The patient is reporting multiple slight shocks
